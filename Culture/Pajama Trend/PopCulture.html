        <h1> PAJAMA TREND Pass or Fail?</h1>
        <p>A trend that has crossed over from the runway, to celebrities, and to the people on city streets; this pajama style has been showing up everywhere. 

            Alexa Portigal, who writes for The Avenue magazine explained how it started out with athleisure and evolving into this, which makes sense. Athleisure is supposed to be comfortable and cute, what I believed to be the point of the pajama fad. I spoke to many different people about this trend, but mainly focused on teenagers because I felt it was largely directed towards them. 
            Most people agreed on the fact that it’s comfortable as a reason to want to wear this. The only reason that majority of the people I asked didn’t want to wear certain outfits were the prints on them.

            The actual look and aesthetic was seen as good.I asked where would you wear this to? Johanna Guan, a sophomore who attends Cathedral high school in Manhattan, said that the look was cute for a party. However many of the people I spoke to said otherwise. Like
            Pamela (a Renaissance Charter student) said she'd wear this to an interview. And Fernando (also a Renaissance Charter student) said how he'd only wear this to some kind of event, like a get together. This shows how teens have accepted this trend.
