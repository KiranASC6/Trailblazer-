        <h1>Medellin</h1>
        <p>I’m Colombian. I don’t like how people see some colombians. They compare us to the past Colombian version where Pablo Escobar was in control of Colombia. 
        The city of the eternal spring-like climate. The City of the Flowers. Medellin is more than a Pablo Escobar and drugs. Medellin has progressed a lot since the fall of the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar. 
        Medellin is known for its music and its friendly people. It has beautiful nightlife. Medellin has a lot of wonderful places to go to. For example El Parque Explora. It's a wonderful science park with a sizable Aquarium.

        Medellin as a lot of good transportation. They have the Metro, Tranvia, and the Metrocable. Places to go and visit is “El Poblado”. El Poblado is a place where people hang out or to take a break.  The Netflix show “Narcos” is a stereotypical depiction of what they think still is.
        Pablo Escobar had caused so many deaths in Colombia. It was another depiction of Colombia as the benighted hostage of a murderous drug baron, corrupt politicians and a civil conflict that has left 260,000 and seven million displaced. 
        This is what makes me mad. When someone thinks of Colombia or if it’s mention in a tv show it’s mostly about talking about Drugs or Drug Lords. They made many beautiful things after his death. They made a beautiful bridge named Gilberto Echeverri Mejia Bridge. 
        The bridge was made in 2012. There's a lovely garden in Antioquia Joaquín Antonio Uribe Botanical Garden. I may have not been there and visited but I have many sources that tells me all the good things that Medellin has. Medellin has a lot of towns that are very beautiful. </p>
